Influenza (Flu) commonly presents with fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue, with occasional vomiting and diarrhea in children. Common cold symptoms include a runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, mild body aches, sneezing, and sometimes a low-grade fever. COVID-19 symptoms are similar to flu but may also include shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, nausea, and diarrhea. Diabetes symptoms feature increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, irritability, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores. Hypertension often shows no symptoms but may cause severe headache, vision problems, chest pain, and irregular heartbeat in advanced cases. Asthma manifests as shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, and difficulty sleeping due to respiratory issues. Allergies typically cause sneezing, itching, runny nose, and watery eyes. Gastroenteritis (stomach flu) includes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, and sometimes a low fever. Migraines are characterized by throbbing pain on one side of the head, light sensitivity, nausea, and blurred vision. Depression involves persistent sadness, hopelessness, irritability, fatigue, concentration problems, sleep changes, and appetite or weight changes, and can include physical aches and thoughts of suicide.
